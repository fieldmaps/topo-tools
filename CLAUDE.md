## Verification Over Recall

- Never rely on remembered knowledge for libraries, APIs, or frameworks —
  check installed versions and docs before writing code or making claims
- If you lack verified information, acknowledge uncertainty and investigate
  first rather than speculate

## Code Reuse

When adding a feature that requires logic that already exists elsewhere in the codebase, extract it into a shared module — don't copy it. Duplication is not a "minimal change"; it creates two places to maintain identical behaviour. The rule against premature abstraction applies to inventing new layers of indirection for hypothetical future needs, not to consolidating code that is already proven and used in multiple places.

## Collaboration Style

- Be objective, not agreeable — act as a partner, not a sycophant
- Push back when you disagree, flag tradeoffs honestly, don't sugarcoat problems
- Keep explanations brief and to the point
- Accuracy over speed

## Solution Choice

- Optimise for the best long-term answer, not the smallest delta from the
  current state. "Minimal change" is expedient, not principled — don't default
  to it. If you're proposing it for scope reasons, say so explicitly.
- When two clean endpoints exist (all-A or all-B), lead with the better one.
  Don't propose hybrids that split the difference unless the hybrid is
  genuinely better than both endpoints — mixed states usually carry the
  costs of both options without the full benefits of either.
- When recommending an approach, name the endpoint you'd actually pick and
  why, before listing alternatives.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev       # Start dev server (localhost:4321)
npm run build     # Production build
npm run preview   # Preview production build
npm run check     # Astro + TypeScript type check
```

## UI Verification

**Always verify UI changes in a real browser before reporting them done.** Type-checking and build success do not prove that a page renders, that an island hydrates, or that user flows work. Use `playwright-cli` (installed at `/opt/homebrew/bin/playwright-cli`) — a terminal wrapper around the Playwright MCP server, drivable from Bash.

Minimal flow:

```bash
npm run dev > /tmp/dev.log 2>&1 &      # background dev server
sleep 4 && grep -E "Local" /tmp/dev.log # find the port (may not be 4321 if busy)
playwright-cli open http://localhost:<port>/
playwright-cli snapshot                  # accessibility-tree snapshot of current page
playwright-cli eval "() => ({ ... })"    # arbitrary JS in page context
playwright-cli click <ref>               # ref comes from snapshot
playwright-cli dialog-accept             # or dialog-dismiss for window.confirm()
playwright-cli close                     # always close at the end
```

Notes:

- `playwright-cli snapshot` writes a YAML accessibility tree to `.playwright-cli/page-*.yml`. The tree includes element `ref` IDs (e.g. `ref=e9`) you pass to `click`/`hover`/`fill`. Trust `eval` output over older snapshot files — snapshots can be stale relative to the live DOM.
- `playwright-cli` uses one persistent browser per session. Use `attach`/`detach` only if you need to share a browser across processes; for our verification flows, `open` + `close` is enough.
- Do NOT write standalone `.spec.ts` files for this — drive Playwright from Bash via `playwright-cli`. (Reason: the project does not have a Playwright test runner configured, and per-test setup duplicates the dev-server lifecycle.)
- For PWA / offline behaviour, `caches.keys()`, `navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations()`, and `localStorage` are all reachable from `eval` for direct state inspection.

## Architecture

**Topology Tools** is a browser-only suite of geospatial topology utilities. Each tool runs client-side via WebAssembly — no data leaves the browser. The root `/` is a landing page that lists tools; today there is one — Edge Extender at `/extend`, which extends polygon boundaries using Voronoi diagrams.

**Stack:** Astro 6 (static site) + Svelte 5 (interactive islands) + DuckDB WASM (spatial SQL engine) + MapLibre GL (map rendering)

### Data flow

```
File drop → format detection + ZIP extraction (DropZone)
  → DuckDB registers file buffer (loader.ts)
  → 5-stage SQL pipeline (src/lib/tools/edge-extender/pipeline/):
      layer_01: load & normalize geometry (MakeValid, Transform to EPSG:4326, Force2D)
      layer_02: extract boundaries (ST_Boundary, ST_LineMerge, minus neighbor overlap)
      layer_03: interpolate points along boundaries (ST_LineInterpolatePoints, no endpoints)
      layer_04: generate Voronoi diagram (ST_VoronoiDiagram, ST_Intersects point→cell assignment)
      layer_05: merge cells (ST_Node all boundaries, ST_Polygonize, point-in-polygon reassignment)
  → export GeoJSON → MapLibre renders result
```

### Key design decisions

- **All geospatial logic is SQL.** Complex operations (Voronoi, ST_Node, ST_Polygonize, RTREE index) run inside DuckDB's spatial extension, not JavaScript.
- **DuckDB WASM constraints:** single-threaded (`SET threads = 1`), vite optimization excluded. The `duckdb.svelte.ts` singleton initializes the spatial extension and handles connection lifecycle.
- **Retry on failure:** `src/lib/tools/edge-extender/pipeline/index.ts` automatically retries with doubled point-spacing distance when Voronoi generation fails (memory/precision issues).
- **Tool layout convention:** Each tool lives at `src/lib/tools/<slug>/` (its `App.svelte` + a `pipeline/` directory if it has one) and has a route at `src/pages/<slug>.astro`. Shared infrastructure stays in `src/lib/db/` (DuckDB singleton + loader + export) and `src/lib/components/` (DropZone, MapView, DownloadMenu, OfflineToggle, ToolCard). Adding a tool = new folder under `tools/`, new entry in `src/lib/tools.ts`, new page, optionally an icon under `public/icons/tools/`. No infrastructure changes.
- **No COEP/COOP.** The mvp/eh DuckDB variants are single-threaded and don't need SharedArrayBuffer (and we exclude the coi variant anyway — it breaks OPFS FSAH clones). Dropping COEP `require-corp` is what lets us fetch the spatial extension cross-origin from `extensions.duckdb.org` (which doesn't send CORP). Don't re-add COEP unless you've audited the cross-origin fetches it would block.
- **Svelte 5 runes:** Uses `$state()`, `$effect()`, and `untrack()` — not legacy Svelte reactivity.
- **Path alias:** `$lib` resolves to `src/lib/` (configured in both the Vite alias in `astro.config.mjs` and the `paths` map in `tsconfig.json` so Astro/TS check sees it too).

### Reference Docs

- `docs/performance.md` — WASM memory model, SPATIAL_JOIN behaviour differences vs. Linux, lines stage evolution, connection settings, pipeline phase memory profile

### Supported input formats

GeoJSON, GeoParquet, GeoPackage, Shapefile (zip), KML, GML, GPX. Loader detects format, extracts from ZIPs via `fflate`, and registers buffers with DuckDB. GeoParquet is loaded without `ST_Read` (no geometry tag); all others use `ST_Read`.
